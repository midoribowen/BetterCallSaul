# Better Call Saul

#### A look-up app for legal services, Saturday June 25th, 2016

#### By Midori Bowen

## Description

Better Call Saul is an Android app where users can look up legal services through Yelp and view them in a detail-view. This is an app to learn new Android skills. Current features I've implemented include: Retrofit and a CollapsingToolbar.

To-Do: Add landscape views

Future features for continued learning:
* MVP architecture
* Shared-element Activity transition
* GcmTaskService
* LoaderManager
* SQLiteOpenHelper
* StateListDrawable

## Setup/Installation Requirements
You will need the following programs installed on your computer.
* Android Studio
* Java JDK 8+
* Android SDK

### To Run BetterCallSaul
* In a terminal window, navigate to ~/AndroidStudioProjects
* Run `git clone https://github.com/midoribowen/BetterCallSaul.git`
* Navigate to ~/AndroidStudioProjects/BetterCallSaul
* Get your api keys and tokens from the Yelp developer website: https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview
* Create a gradle.properties file.
  * Add the following to the gradle.properties file:
  ``` java
YelpConsumerKey = "<your consumer key here>"
YelpConsumerSecret = "<your consumer secret here>"
YelpToken = "<your yelp token here>"
YelpTokenSecret = "<your token secret here>"
```
* Run on either an emulator or an Android OS Device connected to a computer

##### To set up an emulator

##### To Run on an Android OS Device
* Connect the device to the computer through its USB port
* Make sure USB debugging is enabled (this may pop up in a window when you connect the device or it may need to be checked in the phone's settings)
* Select Run > Run 'app'
* Select the device (If it does not show, USB debugging is probably not enabled)
